# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

    We wanted to look at citibike bike-sharing program in NYC to see if it could be transplanted to a city like Des Moines, Iowa. We were able to get information from Citi Bike website and analyze the data so we could present our findings to you, our investors. After doing research and analyzing the data we feel that Des Moines, Iowas would be a great place to open a bike-sharing program. 

## McDonald’s

	We wanted to see how the density of McDonald’s in Des Moines compared to that of New York City. Does the density of McDonald’s affect where people go to in the city? We think it does. If you look at the most popular starting and ending locations in the city of New York, you will notice that those locations have a McDonald’s that is close by. When someone asked McDonald’s how they choose a new location this is what they had to say, “Our team look at a number of elements when selecting a location for a brand new restaurant such as, area population, existing stores in the area and proximity to Retail parks/Shopping centers. Looking at all of that information the team will then put forward a proposal for a new restaurant.” (https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/help/faq/18665-how-do-you-decide-where-to-open-a-new-restaurant.html) You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. McDonal’s puts these places where they will make money so it will be around places people want to be. Now if you look a Des Moines you will notice that the city of Des Moines has 10 McDonald’s as well. So we could focus our efforts into putting our first bike stations around these locations. Another factor to consider is where people will be going around Des Moines.

## Top Tourist Locations in Des Moines

	According to Planetware.com, these are the top twelve tourist attractions in Des Moines. If we are looking for locations to start these bike stations, this would be a factor we shouldn’t overlook. (https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/des-moines-us-ia-des.htm)

## Other Factors

	The gender breakdown in the population of NYC is 52 percent of its population that is female. Des Moines has 51 percent of its population that is female according to the census bureau. (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219) Males tend to use bike sharing programs more so as you can see the difference between NYC and Des Moines is negligible. Also you can see that more people that use the service are subscribers who pay a monthly fee over customers who will pay every time. Des Moines is also a city with a lot of young people. You can see  on the next slide that our target range of people is the younger crowd since they tend to ride longer that people born before 1990. Des Moines has has only 12 percent of the population that is over 65 and 25 percent that is under 18. Those are better demographics when compared to NYC that has 14 percent over 65 and only 21 percent under 18.

## Matinence 

	You can see on the last slide that the peak usage hours would be between 4 and 8 in the evening, This can help us plan when we would need to fix in bikes that have a problem. You can also see that very few people use the bikes from 11 PM to 5 AM. This is when we would need to do any repairs. During this month alone CitiBike brought in $ 6,504,391.47 in revenue according to their website. (https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/August-2019-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20191217092445) I think it would be very smart money to bet on Des Moines as the next great bike sharing community.
